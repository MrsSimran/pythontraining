name= ("print format")
salary=1.546
age=66

# print(name)
# print(salary)
# print(age)

# approach 1
# print(name,age,salary)
# print("Name is:",name)
# print("Age is:",age)
# print("salary is:",salary)

# approach 2 by using operator %
# print("Name is:%s   Age is:%d  salary is:%g" %(name,age,salary) )#%s is string,#%D is digit,%g is decimal  then variable are called


# approach 3 by using operator {}
print("Name is:{}  Age is:{}  salary is:{}" .format(name,age,salary ))
print("age is:{}  salary is:{}  Name is:{}" .format(name,age,salary )) #when function are called particular variable just put in sequence for output
